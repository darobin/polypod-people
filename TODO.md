# Fake It Till You Make It

That is the focus of this version. Pretty much everything is fake! Haha! But it should work
well enough (with likely imperfect security) that we can use it with multiple people and see
that we have a thing.

Target: EO2024Q3.

## Phase I: August Intentions

- [x] Caddy works locally
- [x] echo. deployment works
  - [x] configuration secrets in GH API?
- [ ] minimal polypod server deploy (caddy + deploy + express)
- [ ] minimal Electron app (copy from previous, unless production it uses local server)
  - [ ] esm stuff
  - [ ] shoelace+lit
  - [ ] nanostore
  - [ ] window settings
- [ ] Login via Bluesky app password
- [ ] Generate key locally and store it safely
- [ ] Save pubkey to server with app pwd to verify
- [ ] Generate invitation
- [ ] Address book management with Bluesky IDs (handle/DID)
- [ ] Group management: each group in its own window + list of docs
- [ ] Tiles + doc instances system + sharing them to the server so they are there for all
- [ ] Secure wrapping of tile context
- [ ] XDC data sharing APIs
- [ ] Wishes
- [ ] Sync system: Yjs, find projects/groups, sync project list, optionally doc content (on demand/load)

## Phase II: Eternal September

- [ ] Business/agent support (e.g. interact with a blog by inviting them to the same group, buy something)
- [ ] ModPol
- [ ] Add participation rules (e.g. chess has two players with watchers, max peopleâ€¦)
- [ ] Need a story for tiles sharing and how they update (Authentic Attributes)
- [ ] Use AuthAttr to create version histories?

## Phase III: October Surprise


## Phase IV: November Rain
