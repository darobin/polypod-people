# polypod-people

An experiment implementing polypody with people+groups as the most fundamental component

## Development

- Any dependency that isn't needed for the server should go into devDependencies, that way
  they don't get installed on deployment.
- Whenever updating shoelace, run `copy-assets.sh`
